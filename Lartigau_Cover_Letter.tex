%\opening{Dear \contactSirOrMadam{} \contactLastName{},}
I am currently pursuing the last year of my Master's program
in software engineering at KTH in Stockholm,
as part of a double degree agreement with the french engineering school Ensimag.
During the past year spent at KTH, I mostly selected courses with an emphasis
on software safety, security, and reliability, as well as several courses
related to artificial intelligence and large-scale software development.

I heard about \company{} during the D-Dagen organized at KTH last October,
and to conclude my studies, I would like to perform a degree project in your company.
My objective will be to work on a specific topic that you are interested in researching
and would benefit \company{}, all the while writing a master thesis
describing the results of the research. \\
We will have the possibility to discuss the subject of the project
in a further discussion if you are interested,
so don't hesitate to propose me any matter that you would like to research
but didn't have the opportunity to do so until now.

My degree project must have a duration of at least 20 weeks;
and while the starting date is not rigorously defined by KTH,
I will be available to begin working as early as my studies are over,
around the end of the month of June. \\
And although I will have to present the results of my work in a seminar
at the end of the project, I will then be fully available to continue working
if the opportunity arises.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need more information
about me or the degree project.

\closing{Yours sincerely,}
\end{letter}
